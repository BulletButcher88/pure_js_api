# IMDB API search with JS, HTML and CSS 

## PROJECT INFORMATION 

An API, with Jquery project. A learning experince in how to access an API though javascript/jquery, made me wonder about the future of APIs. 

After this, I starting to thinking a VHS VS Netflix search engine is a good idea....a place to challenge yourself with edgy cinema.
