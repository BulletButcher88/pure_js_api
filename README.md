# IMDB API search with JS, HTML and CSS 

## PROJECT INFORMATION 

I present... my first  API, with Jquery project. Discovering how to access an API though javascript/jquery, made me wonder about the future of APIs. 

I really wanted to make this app reactive to two API's, but I couldn't draw on classification data.. (got a bit stuck)

I'm starting to think a VHS VS Netflix search engine is a good idea....a place to challenge yourself with edgy cinema. 

Like in the olden days, at the  R rated section at Blockbuster
